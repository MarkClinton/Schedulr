## About.
## (https://www.schedulr.cc/ "Schedulr")

Schedulr is an organizational tool designed to show you a snapshot of your weekly, monthly and daily tasks. View all tasks, your tasks, shared tasks and expired tasks created by you on the task list to the left of the user’s home page, as well as a calendar option on the right. 
All tasks shown on the calendar are color coded depending on the type of task. The color information is found below the calendar for ease of use. A snippet of task information is shown on the task list to the left as well as when you hover over a calendar entry. These tasks can be accessed by clicking on them from either location. 

If you are the creator of a task you will be shown more options, such as edit a task and the ability to add friends to the task. Adding friends will show a list of your friends in a pop up. Friends already added to the task will not appear on the list. To remove friends, click on edit and remove on the right.

There are 3 media options to choose from to add to a task. File, Note and Location. 

The dashboard also shows a list of tasks as cards. Information on the left about the number of tasks, the number of friends and how many group tasks you are in. The option to change your profile picture is below your current profile picture. 

Friends are shown under the friends tab. Friends can be added by email only. 

Profile tab shows your information and a list of 10 of your recent activities. There are only 3 activities which are recorded. Tasks you created, tasks you were added to and who you became friends with.

## Cons.


Planning – A lot of problems were run into due to bad planning and not spending time defining a design doc. 

Mobile – A lot of the mobile resizing lives in the mobile.css file. I should utilize bootstrap more to minimize the amount the manual css I had to use.

Routing – Better routing on Codeigniter. More defined routes. Again, comes back to a design doc and what’s needed before building.

Controllers – I don’t like the way the controllers are built. If I had to scale and add more I think this would be a problem. Again, comes back to a design doc. Some routes and controllers are messy. 

CSS – Utilize bootstrap more. Don’t try to reinvent the wheel when it comes to CSS.

Moment.js – Time and formats were difficult. I could have used moment.js more to save time.


In all these problems could have been minimized by defining a design doc at the start.
